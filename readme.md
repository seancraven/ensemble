## Objective:
Build ensemble training rig, such that I can train multiple agents at the same time on one gpu, required for time.


## JAX:
- I can get the model to run without any functions being jitted in the current state however it is so slow that I don't think that it is worth it. I have to rewrite everything I think.
- The current structure is quite far away from what I shoudl expect
